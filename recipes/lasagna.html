    <h1>Lasagna</h1>
    <img src="../images/lasagna.jpg" alt="lasagna dish" />
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Lasagna is the name of one of the oldest and best-known pasta shapes.
      <br />It is usually rectangular or ribbon shaped, thicker than
      tagliatelle, made from a dough based on flour and eggs, with numerous
      local variants.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Meat: This lasagna recipe starts with a pound of ground meat (½ pound
        ground pork, ½ pound lean ground beef).
      </li>

      <li>
        Onion: A diced onion is cooked until translucent with the ground meat.
      </li>

      <li>
        Canned tomatoes: You'll need a can of tomato sauce and a can of crushed
        tomatoes.
      </li>

      <li>
        Fresh herbs: For fresh flavor, chop two tablespoons of parsley and crush
        one clove of garlic.
      </li>

      <li>
        Sugar: A dash of sugar balances out all of the acidity from the
        tomatoes.
      </li>

      <li>
        Spices and seasonings: This homemade lasagna is seasoned with dried
        basil, dried oregano, salt, and black pepper.
      </li>

      <li>
        Noodles: Of course, you'll need lasagna noodles! This recipe calls for
        uncooked noodles, but you can use the oven-ready variety to save time.
      </li>

      <li>
        Cheese: The cheese layer is made up of cottage cheese and Parmesan.
        You'll also need shredded mozzarella.
      </li>

      <li>
        Eggs: Eggs make the cheese layer extra creamy. Plus, they act as a
        binding agent (which means they hold the layer together).
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Make the meat sauce – Cook onions, garlic, ground meat, tomato paste,
        crushed tomatoes, and seasonings. Simmer.
      </li>
      <li>
        Prepare the cheese layer – Mix ricotta (or make béchamel) with egg,
        Parmesan, and seasoning.
      </li>
      <li>
        Boil the lasagna sheets – Only if you're not using oven-ready sheets.
      </li>
      <li>
        Assemble the lasagna – Layer sauce, pasta sheets, cheese mixture, and
        mozzarella. Repeat layers.
      </li>
      <li>Top it off – Finish with sauce and extra cheese on top.</li>
      <li>
        Bake – Cover with foil and bake at 180°C (350°F) for 25–30 minutes.
        Uncover and bake another 10–15 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Rest and serve – Let it rest for 10–15 minutes before slicing and
        serving.
