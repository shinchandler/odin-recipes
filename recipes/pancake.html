    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Pancakes are a beloved breakfast staple enjoyed around the
      world for their fluffy texture and endless topping possibilities. <br />
      from a simple batter of flour, milk, eggs, and leavening agents like
      baking powder, pancakes cook quickly on a hot griddle or pan, forming
      golden-brown rounds that are soft on the inside and slightly crisp on the
      edges
